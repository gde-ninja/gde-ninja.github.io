Another nice area of exploration is real-time data processing. Our mobile phones are packed with interesting sensors, we get sound, video, accelerometer data and potentially very [exotic](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/903107259/scio-your-sixth-sense-a-pocket-molecular-sensor-fo)
[things](http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2011-10/so-um-why-does-new-google-phone-have-barometer-it) things.

As a first practical example, we'll create an [FFT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) based [spectrum analyzer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_analyzer). We'll focus on analyzing sounds for our example, but you can use it to analyze many [types of signals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform#Applications). 

First off we'll look at where to get our information. We'll first focus on grabbing audio data from our device's microphone, and then try to analyze sound files.

The Fourier Transform allows us to take samples of our input waveform / time series, and calculate power / frequency. We'll then want to graph this information in various, pretty ways.

You can follow the code samples[^1] without a deep understanding of the math, but there's a [lot](http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3374611/Fun-with-Java-How-and-Why-Spectral-Analysis-Works.htm) of [available](http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3457251/Fun-with-Java-Understanding-the-Fast-Fourier-Transform-FFT-Algorithm.htm) [material](http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3380031/Spectrum-Analysis-using-Java-Sampling-Frequency-Folding-Frequency-and-the-FFT-Algorithm.htm) on FFT/DFT I'll be linking to, if you're interesting in digging a bit deeper.
